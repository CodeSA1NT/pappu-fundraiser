        <p>
            Our dear friend Ashish is going through one of the most difficult phases of his life. His hard-earned savings were stolen, leaving him stranded in Bangalore with no financial support.
            He is far from home far from his family in Ranchi, and without enough money to even return. The city he once came to with hopes and dreams has suddenly become a place of uncertainty and struggle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine being stuck in a new city with no savings and no immediate way back home. It’s not just financially stressful, it’s emotionally overwhelming.
            We are coming together to support him during this challenging time. Every contribution, no matter how small, will help him return home safely and begin rebuilding his life.
            Let’s stand by him and remind him that he is not alone.
        </p>
